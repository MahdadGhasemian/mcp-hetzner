# mcp-hetzner
A Go Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for interacting with the Hetzner Cloud API.

---

## üõ† Build Client
```bash
npm --prefix ./client i
npm --prefix ./client run build
```

## üñ• Build Server
```bash
go mod init github.com/MahdadGhasemian/mcp-hetzner-go
go mod tidy
go build -o mcphetzner
# go run main.go
```

## üöÄ Run Client
```bash
node ./client/build/index.js ./mcp-hetzner
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Usage Restrictions

The server supports two operation modes, controlled by the configuration:

- **Read-Only mode**: Only allows **GET** and **LIST** operations.
- **Read-Write mode**: Allows **GET**, **LIST**, and **CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE** operations.

**By default, the server starts in read-only mode.**  
To enable write operations (such as creating, updating, or deleting resources), you must explicitly set the configuration flag to enable read-write mode.

> **Warning**: Enabling write mode allows the client to make changes to your Hetzner Cloud resources.  
> Ensure you understand the implications and have proper access controls in place.

### Switching Modes

Edit your configuration or pass the relevant environment variable/flag at launch:

- For **read-only** (default; safe for inspection and monitoring):
    ```
    ./mcphetzner --mode=read_only
    ```
- For **read-write** (use with caution!):
    ```
    ./mcphetzner --mode=read_write
    ```
